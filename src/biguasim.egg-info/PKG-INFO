## Features
 - 3+ rich worlds with various infrastructure for generating data or testing underwater algorithms
 - Complete with common underwater sensors including DVL, IMU, optical camera, various sonar, depth sensor, and more
 - Highly and easily configurable sensors and missions
 - Multi-agent missions, including optical and acoustic communications
 - Novel sonar simulation framework for simulating imaging, profiling, sidescan, and echosounder sonars
 - Imaging sonar implementation includes realistic noise modeling for small sim-2-real gap
 - Easy installation and simple, OpenAI Gym-like Python interface
 - High performance - simulation speeds of up to 2x real time are possible. Performance penalty only for what you need
 - Run headless or watch your agents learn
 - Linux and Windows support

## Installation
`pip install biguasim`

(requires >= Python 3.6)

See [Installation](https://biguasim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/installation.html) for complete instructions.

- Docker usage:
`docker run -it \
  --name biguasim \
  --privileged \
  --ipc=host \

## Usage Overview
BiguaSim's interface is similar to [OpenAI's Gym](https://gym.openai.com/). 

We try and provide a batteries included approach to let you jump right into using BiguaSim, with minimal
fiddling required.

To demonstrate, here is a quick example using the `DefaultWorlds` package:

```python
import biguasim

# Load the environment. This environment contains a hovering AUV in a pier
env = biguasim.make("PierHarbor-Hovering")

# You must call `.reset()` on a newly created environment before ticking/stepping it
env.reset()                         

# The AUV takes commands for each thruster
command = [0, 0, 0, 0, 10, 10, 10, 10]   

for i in range(30):
    state = env.step(command)  
```

- `state`: dict of sensor name to the sensor's value (nparray).

If you want to access the data of a specific sensor, import sensors and
retrieving the correct value from the state dictionary:

```python
print(state["DVLSensor"])
```

## Multi Agent-Environments
BiguaSim supports multi-agent environments.

Calls to [`step`](https://biguasim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/biguasim/environments.html#biguasim.environments.BiguaSimEnvironment.step) only provide an action for the main agent, and then tick the simulation. 

[`act`](https://biguasim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/biguasim/environments.html#biguasim.environments.BiguaSimEnvironment.act) provides a persistent action for a specific agent, and does not tick the simulation. After an 
action has been provided, [`tick`](https://biguasim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/biguasim/environments.html#biguasim.environments.BiguaSimEnvironment.tick) will advance the simulation forward. The action is persisted until another call to `act` provides a different action.

```python
import biguasim
import numpy as np

env = biguasim.make("Dam-Hovering")
env.reset()

# Provide an action for each agent
env.act('auv0', np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 10, 10, 10, 10]))

# Advance the simulation
for i in range(300):
  # The action provided above is repeated
  states = env.tick()
```

You can access the sensor states as before:

```python
dvl = states["auv0"]["DVLSensor"]
location = states["auv0"]["DepthSensor"]
```

(`auv0` comes from the [scenario configuration file](https://biguasim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packages/docs/scenarios.html))

## Running BiguaSim Headless
BiguaSim can run headless with GPU accelerated rendering. See [Using BiguaSim Headless](https://biguasim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage/running-headless.html)
