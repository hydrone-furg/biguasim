BiguaSim is a high-fidelity simulator developed by `Nautec <https://nautec.furg.br/>`_
at `Federal University of Rio Grande <https://www.furg.br>`_ .

Features
""""""""
#. Multi-Domain Simulation Environments: Rich, high-fidelity worlds supporting simultaneous operations of both air and water vehicles (UAVs and AUVs).
#. Powered by Unreal Engine 5 (UE5): Leverages modern UE5 rendering and physics for maximum visual realism and high-detail environments.
#. Synthetic Dataset Generation: Purpose-built infrastructure for generating realistic, annotated synthetic data to train perception and AI models.
#. Comprehensive Sensor Suite: Complete with common multi-domain sensors including DVL, IMU, optical cameras, high-precision depth cameras, and more, customized for both aerial and underwater domains.
#. Advanced Hybrid Sonar Framework: Novel simulation framework for imaging, profiling, sidescan, and singlebeam sonars, featuring simultaneous Ground Truth (GT) extraction and realistic stochastic noise modeling.
#. Sim-2-Real Focus: Realistic sensor noise and physics modeling designed to minimize the sim-to-real gap for seamless algorithm deployment.
#. Multi-Agent Missions: Easily configure and scale complex multi-robot missions.
#. OpenAI Gym-like Python Interface: Simple installation and intuitive API for testing robotics algorithms and training Reinforcement Learning agents.
#. High Performance & Flexibility: Configurable execution speeds. Run visually or in headless mode. Pay a computational penalty only for the features you need.
#. Cross-Platform: Full support for Linux and Windows.
