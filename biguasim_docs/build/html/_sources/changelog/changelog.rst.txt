.. Changelog Style Guide
  - Each release should have a New Features / Changes / Bug Fixes section.
  - Keep the first sentence of each point short and descriptive
  - The passive voice should be avoided
  - Try to make the first word a verb in past tense. Bug fixes should use
    "Fixed"
  - Add a link to the issue describing the change or the pull request that
    merged it at the end in parentheses
